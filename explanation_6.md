Problem #6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
Design
by default, I take the min and max to be the first element of the input_list. I iterate through the input list and compare the elements with min and max variables. If the condition is satisfied then I assign the elements to the min and max variables.
Else continue until the end of the input list

Big O Space Complexity
Two variables to hold min and max and input list of n elements: O(n)

Big O Time Complexity
Iterating through the input list takes O(n) with n being number of elements in list
