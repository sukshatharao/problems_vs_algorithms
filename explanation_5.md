Problem #5: Autocomplete With Tries
Design
Uses a default dictionary to store each letters. Lookups and insertions should be faster than a BST (learnt from the class at Udacity).

Big O Space Complexity
with dictionary the worst case is O(n); where n is the number of characters in a string.

Big O Time Complexity
insertion and finding a word takes O(n); where n is the length of the search string.
